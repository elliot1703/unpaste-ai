## Part 2: Client Analysis & Patterns

### Documented Client Results

| Client | Contact | Industry | Problem | Solution | Result |
|--------|---------|----------|---------|----------|--------|
| Dermis (Thomas Gonnet) | Director | Healthcare/Skincare | Client onboarding taking 36 hours per account | Agentic system for automated onboarding | 36 hours → 1 hour (97% reduction) |
| Canberra Art Gallery (Keith Murphy) | Director | Arts/Cultural | Proposals and reporting consuming 9 hours/week | Automated reporting system | 9 hours → 25 minutes/week |
| Trailbook (Shahni Scrivner) | Director | Travel/Tourism | Scattered across 4 tools with constant manual effort | Unified automated system | 25 hours/week saved, 72% error reduction |
| The Modern Brides (Kristine Satorre) | Director | Wedding/Events | Slow inquiry response (4.2 hour average) | Automated inquiry workflow | 4.2 hours → 3 minutes response, 85% auto-handled |
| Fulcrum (Denzel Marthinussen) | Founder | SMB/Unknown | High operating costs, hidden bottlenecks | Workflow mapping + automation | 23.1% cost reduction in 60 days |
| Innovativa (Gonzalo Ferreira) | Director | Consulting/Agency | Client bandwidth constraints | AI agents suite | 2.5× client capacity increase |

### Pattern Recognition

**Client Profile:**
- All Australian businesses
- SMB/SME size (not enterprise despite "enterprise" positioning)
- Service-based businesses (not product companies)
- Decision makers are Directors/Founders (not middle management)
- Businesses with existing revenue and operational pain

**Problem Categories:**
1. **Onboarding/intake processes** (Dermis, Modern Brides)
2. **Reporting and proposals** (Canberra Art Gallery)
3. **Multi-tool chaos** (Trailbook)
4. **Response time/customer service** (Modern Brides)
5. **Capacity constraints** (Innovativa)
6. **General operational inefficiency** (Fulcrum)

**Result Presentation Formula:**
- Always quantified (hours, percentages, multipliers)
- Before → After format
- Specific timeframe when possible (e.g., "in 60 days")
- Personal quote from Director/Founder

---

## Part 3: Messaging & Positioning Analysis

### Headline Architecture

**Primary Headline:**
> "The Single Score That Reveals How Much Your Operations Underperform."

**Characteristics:**
- Single, bold statement
- Creates urgency through implied inadequacy
- Promises clarity (single score vs. complexity)
- Uses "reveal" language (hidden problem uncovered)

### Supporting Messages

**About Section:**
> "We built the Advantage Index to measure operational inefficiency and give leadership teams a single score that reveals where your operations underperform."

**Value Statement:**
> "In 15 questions, the Advantage Index scores your operations from 0-100, benchmarks you against similar companies and identifies the 3-5 processes doing the most damage to your bottom line."

### Four Service Pillars

| # | Service | Description | Visual Treatment |
|---|---------|-------------|------------------|
| 01 | Artificial Intelligence | "We build AI systems that automate repetitive tasks, from follow ups to data entry, without needing human oversight." | Search interface animation |
| 02 | Business Operations | "We design efficient, scalable operations that turn complexity into clarity through process and software." | Department selector UI |
| 03 | Software Integrations | "We connect scattered tools into unified systems that eliminate manual work and make data flow automatically." | Tool logos (Google, Slack, Xero) |
| 04 | Custom Development | "We build tailored applications that solve problems off the shelf software cannot, giving you competitive advantage." | Mobile app gallery |

### Process Steps (3-Step Framework)

1. **Audit Your Operations** - "We review your Advantage Index and show you where time, effort, and margin are wasted."
2. **Identify The Constraint** - "We identify the biggest bottleneck holding the business back and show you what is causing it."
3. **Get Your Custom Roadmap** - "You leave with a 5 week roadmap showing you exactly what to automate, delegate, or eliminate."

### FAQ Structure

Questions addressed:
- What is the Advantage Index?
- Who is the Advantage Index for?
- Is the Advantage Index really free to use?
- Do I need detailed data to complete the Advantage Index?
- What should I expect to happen after I complete the Advantage Index?

## Part 5: Strategic Approach for Unpaste.ai

### Current Philosophy: Broad Before Narrow

**Why stay broad initially:**
- Need to discover which use cases are most efficient to deliver
- Need to learn which client types are easiest to work with
- Need to build case studies across different contexts
- Avoid premature optimization before market signals

**Discovery-led approach:**
- Take diverse projects initially
- Document everything (time spent, client friction, results achieved)
- Let patterns emerge naturally
- Niche down once data supports a clear winner

### Positioning (Broad Version)

**Tagline Options:**
- "AI automation for businesses who are too busy to fix how they work"
- "Turn operational chaos into automated clarity"
- "The systems your business needs, built by someone who gets it"

**Target Market (Intentionally Broad):**
- Australian SMBs with 2-50 employees
- Service-based businesses (any vertical initially)
- Owners/Directors who feel the pain personally
- Businesses already using multiple software tools
- Revenue of $500K-$10M (enough pain, enough budget)

### Assessment Tool Concept

**Name Options:**
- Efficiency Score
- Operations Readiness Score
- Automation Potential Score
- The Unpaste Score

**Approach:**
- Keep questions industry-agnostic
- Focus on universal pain points (time, tools, follow-ups, admin)
- Allow assessment data to reveal which industries respond best

### Proposed 15 Questions Framework (Industry-Agnostic)

**Section 1: Current Operations (Questions 1-5)**
1. How many hours per week does your team spend on manual data entry or copy-pasting between systems?
2. How many different software tools does your business use on a daily basis?
3. How often do customer inquiries or follow-ups slip through the cracks?
4. What's your average response time to new customer inquiries?
5. How much time do you spend creating quotes, proposals, or reports each week?

**Section 2: Pain Points (Questions 6-10)**
6. Which manual process frustrates you or your team the most? (Open text)
7. How often do you work evenings or weekends to catch up on admin?
8. Have you ever lost a customer due to slow response or missed follow-up?
9. How much time do you spend on invoicing and payment chasing per month?
10. Do your tools talk to each other automatically, or do you manually transfer information?

**Section 3: Readiness & Context (Questions 11-15)**
11. Have you tried any automation tools before? (Zapier, Make, etc.)
12. What's your biggest operational bottleneck right now? (Open text)
13. If you could automate one thing tomorrow, what would it be? (Open text)
14. How much would saving 10 hours per week be worth to your business?
15. What industry/type of business are you in? (Open text - for segmentation data)

**Note:** Questions 6, 12, 13, and 15 are open text specifically to gather qualitative data for niche discovery.

### Service Pillars for Unpaste.ai

### Claude Code Kickoff Prompt

Use this prompt to initialize the project with Claude Code:

```
I'm building Unpaste.ai, an AI automation consulting business. I have a strategy document (STRATEGY.md) that contains:

1. Analysis of a competitor (PRGRMMD) whose model I'm adapting
2. My positioning approach (staying broad initially to discover best niches)
3. A 15-question assessment framework
4. Website copy drafts
5. Case study templates
6. Funnel structure

Current priorities (in order):
1. Set up the project folder structure
2. Review and refine the 15-question assessment
3. Create the scoring logic for the assessment
4. Plan the assessment delivery mechanism (Typeform? Tally? Custom?)

I want to build this iteratively. Start by reading STRATEGY.md, then help me set up the foundation. We'll tackle one element at a time.

Key context:
- I'm based in Brisbane, Australia
- I run a landscaping business (Local Fix) on the side, managed by a VA
- I have two potential case studies in progress: Paul (cabinetry) and Aimee (design studio)
- I'm intentionally staying broad on niches until I have data on what works
- This project will evolve—some things will be paused, pivoted, or deprioritized based on what we learn

What questions do you have before we begin?
```

### Modular Build Approach

Each element can be built independently:

| Module | Description | Dependencies | Priority |
|--------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| Assessment Questions | The 15 questions refined | None | High |
| Scoring Logic | How to calculate and interpret scores | Assessment Questions | High |
| Assessment Delivery | Platform choice and setup | Scoring Logic | High |
| Landing Page | Single page with assessment embed | Assessment Delivery | High |
| Email Sequence | Post-assessment nurture | Assessment Delivery | Medium |
| Full Website | All pages built out | Landing Page proven | Medium |
| Case Study System | Template and tracking | Active clients | Medium |
| CRM/Pipeline | Track leads and projects | Landing Page live | Low |
| Automation Templates | Reusable client deliverables | Completed projects | Low |

### Decision Log Template

Track decisions as the project evolves:

```markdown
## Decision: [Title]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

**Context:**
[What situation prompted this decision?]

**Options Considered:**
1. Option A - [pros/cons]
2. Option B - [pros/cons]
3. Option C - [pros/cons]

**Decision:**
[What was decided]

**Rationale:**
[Why this option was chosen]

**Next Actions:**
- [ ] Action 1
- [ ] Action 2

**Review Date:** [When to revisit if needed]
```
